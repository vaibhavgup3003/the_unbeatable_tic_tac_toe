# the_unbeatable_tic_tac_toe
This is the implementation of the MINIMAX Algorithm to develop an definitely UNBEATABLE TIC_TAC_TOE game using C++ programming language.

The Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project is an advanced implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed
to provide an unbeatable challenge to players. This project implements the sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI)
technique i.e the MINIMAX algorithm leading to an unbeatable gameplay experience to the users.

The repo contains the full C++ code of the using which can be executed in the terminal using the command:
`g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -0 tic_tac_toe 
./tic_tac_toe`
